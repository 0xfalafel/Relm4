An idiomatic GUI library inspired by [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and based on [gtk4-rs](https://crates.io/crates/gtk4). 
Relm4 is a new version of [relm](https://github.com/antoyo/relm) that's built from scratch and is compatible with [GTK4](https://www.gtk.org/).

## Goals

+ ‚è±Ô∏è **Productivity:** Writing an application should require as few overhead as possible
+ ‚ö° **Flexibility:** Anything that's possible to do with GTK4 should be possible in Relm4 as well
+ ‚ú® **Simplicity:** Writing an application should be as easy and straight forward as possible
+ üîß **Maintainability**: The Elm programming model used by Relm4 provides a simple and clear structure for app development

## Documentation

+ üìñ **[Book](https://aaronerhardt.github.io/relm4-book/book/)**
+ **[Rust documenation](https://aaronerhardt.github.io/docs/relm4/relm4/)**

## Dependencies

Relm4 only depends on GTK4: [How to install GTK4](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/)

## Ecosystem

Relm4 has two crates that extend the core functionality:

+ [relm4-macros](https://crates.io/crates/relm4-macros) provides a `widget` macro that simplifies UI creation
+ [relm4-components](https://crates.io/crates/relm4-components) is a collections of reusable components you can easily integrate into your application

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
gtk = { version = "0.2", package = "gtk4" }
relm4 = "0.1.0-beta.5"
relm4-macros = "0.1.0-beta.5"
relm4-components = "0.1.0-beta.5"
```

## Examples

Several example applications are available at [relm4-examples/](relm4-examples/).
